Digiton core library package.

This package will host reusable modules (signal generation, SDR baseband,
protocols, channel models). User-facing programs remain at repository root.

Planned modules:
- wavelets: Complex Morlet generation, envelopes, spectra
- sdr: I/Q downconversion, filters, matched filters
- protocol: auto-speed negotiation, WPP MAC, framing
- channel: Watterson/Rayleigh channel simulation
